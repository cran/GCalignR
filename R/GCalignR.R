#'@details
#' Gas-chromatography (GC) & gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) are
#' powerful analytical separation techniques that can be used for diverse
#' applications. Even though gas-chromatography is highly sensitive and retention
#' times are substance-specific (in equal settings), small systematic shifts in
#' chromatograms as well as unavoidable inaccuracies in peak detection make it difficult
#' to compare chromatograms and analyse patterns across samples. GCalignR provides functions
#' to align chromatography peaks across samples based on retention times and simple means of evaluating the
#' quality of the alignment.
