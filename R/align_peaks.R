#'align peaks individually among chromatograms
#'
#'@description \strong{align_peaks} allows to align similar peaks across samples
#'so that shared peaks are consistently located at the the same location (i.e.
#'defined as the same substance). The order of chromatograms (i.e. data.frames
#'in \code{gc_peak_list}) is randomized before each run of the alignment of
#'algorithm. The main principle of this function is to reduce the variance in
#'retention times within rows, thereby peaks of similar retention time are
#'grouped together. Peaks that deviate signifantly from the mean retention times
#'of the other samples are shifted to another row. At the start of a row the
#'first two samples are compared and seperated if required, then all other
#'samples are included consecutively. If \code{iterations > 1} the whole
#'alogorithm is repeated accordingly.
#'
#'@details For each row the retention time of every sample is compared to the
#'mean retention time of all previously examined samples within the same row.
#'Starting with the second sample a comparison is done between the first and the
#'second sample, then between the third and the two first ones and so on.
#'Whenever the current sample shows a deviation from the mean retention time of
#'the previous samples a shift will either move this sample to the next row
#'(i.e. retention time above average) or all other samples will be moved to the
#'next row (i.e. retention time below average). If the retention time of the
#'sample in evaluation shows no deviation within \strong{-max_diff_peak2mean}:
#'\strong{max_diff_peak2mean} around the mean retention time no shifting is done
#'and the alogrithm proceeds with the following sample.
