\usage{
norm_peaks(data, conc_col_name = NULL, rt_col_name = NULL,
  out = c("data.frame", "list"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Object of class GCalign created with \link{align_chromatograms}. Contains a list
of data frames including the retention time and other variables, of which one needs
to be specified as \code{conc_col_name}.}

\item{conc_col_name}{Character string denoting a column in data frames of \code{data}
containing a variable describing the abundance of peaks (e.g. peak area or peak height).}

\item{rt_col_name}{Character string - the name of the column containing the retention times.The variable needs to
be numeric and the decimal separator needs to be a point.}

\item{out}{character string defining the format of the returned data. Either "List" or "data.frame".}
}
\value{
Depending on \code{out} either a list of data frame or a single data frame were rows represent samples and columns relative peak abundancies. Abundancies are given in percent.

\description{
\code{norm_peaks} calculates the relative abundance of a peak by normalising
with regard to the cumulative abundance of all peaks that are present within an
individual chromatogram. The desired measure of peak abundance needs to be a column
within the original gas-chromatography dataset aligned by \link{align_chromatograms}.
}
\examples{
## aligned gc-dataset
data("aligned_peak_data")
## returns normalised peak area
norm_peaks(data = aligned_peak_data, conc_col_name = "area", rt_col_name = "time")

}
