\description{
This dataset is comprised of substances and their corresponding retention times that have been identified in a chemical dataset from cephalic labial gland secretion of the bumblebee *Bombus flavifrons* (Dellicour and Lecocq 2013). Samples are the same as in \code{\link{bfla}}.
}
\details{
Data was extracted from Table 4 of the supporting information from Dellicour and Lecocq (2013). We removed all rows that contain retention times of unknown substances to allow the data beeing used for a conservative estimation of alignment errors of the dataset \code{\link{bfla}}.
