## Introduction

`GCalignR` provides a simple means of aligning peaks from gas chromatography data based on retention times. The package also contains functions to visually evaluate the quality of the alignment and allow users to adjust the algorithm parameters to optimize the alignment. The aligned data can easily be used as input for statistical packages such as `vegan`. We specifically developed and tested `GCalignR` as a preprocessing tool prior to the statistical analysis of chemical samples from animal skin and preen glands [see @stoffel2015chemical for an application of the underlying algorithm]. The implemented algorithm is purely based on retention time data, which is why the quality of the alignment is highly dependent on the quality of the raw data and the parameters used for the initial peak detection. In other words: The clearer the peaks are which were extracted from the chromatograms, the better the alignment will be. `GCalignR` has been created for situations where the main interest of the research is in exploring broader patterns rather then the specific function of a certain chemical, which is unlikely to be determined correctly in all cases when just retention times are used. Also, we highly recommend to at least partially double-check the resulting alignment with mass-spectrometry data (of available) or visual ways of comparing peaks across chromatograms.

## GCalignR workflow in a larger context

In the flow diagram below, we visualized the functionality of GCalignR within a complete workflow of analysing chemical data. After (1) analysis of the chemical samples with GC or GC-MS, an often proprietary software is used to extract a list of peaks (retention times, peak area, also often peak height and other variables). Steps (3)-(7) are the the alignment steps within GCalignR, detailed below. After alignment and normalisation, the output can be used as input for multivariate statistics in other packages such as vegan (8). 

```{r, out.width = 650, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("workflow.png") 
```

## Installation

The development version can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/mastoffel/GCalignR) with the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
install.packages("devtools") 
devtools::install_github("mastoffel/GCalignR", build_vignettes = TRUE) 
```

```{r} 
library("GCalignR") 
```

The package documentation can be accessed with:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
?GCalignR # documentation
```

## The functions below form the core of `GCalignR`:

* `align_chromatograms`: 
Aligns gas-chromatography peak data by retention times. The main function of the package.
* `gc_heatmap`: 
Plots the results (and intermediate steps) of the alignment. A heatmap allows the user to visually
inspect the quality of the alignment to adjust the parameters accordingly if necessary.
* `check_input`: 
Checks the format of the input data for conformity with the requirements and highlights violations.
* `plot.GCalign`: 
Plots the distribution of peaks after the alignment and shows density histograms of applied linear
transformations and retention time ranges (i.e. difference between minimum and maximum retention time per substance).
* `print.GCalign`: 
Summarises the alignment procedure (e.g. documents all arguments to the function call).
* `norm_peaks`: 
Normalises the abundance measure of peaks and returns a data frame of peak concentrations for all samples that is ready to use for analysis tools such as `vegan::nmds`


## The alignment algorithm

The alignment algorithm implemented in the `align_chromatograms` function contains the following steps:
(Here we refer to a peak list as all extracted peaks from a given sample chromatogram)

1. One sample provides a reference peak list, which is used to align all other peak lists
by means of shifting them simultaneously to maximise the number of shared peaks with the reference. This step corrects systematic shifts in the retention times of chromatograms. The maximum shift can be specified with the `max_linear_shift` argument. 

2. After the complete chromatograms are aligned, there will still be variation in the retention time of a substance across samples. The second step corrects this unreliability of individual peak retention times and essentially tries to minimise variation within a retention time row. The maximum shift per peak can be specified with the `max_diff_peak2mean` argument.

3. Inherent to the algorithm, the same substance might have been split apart into two substances across all samples. Therefore, in a third step, retention time rows are merged if they have similar retention time means and non of the samples shows peaks in both rows (with the assumption that these two rows represent a single substance). The maximum mean difference between two retention time rows can be specified with the `min_diff_peak2peak` argument. 

### Optional steps:

4. Delete peaks that occur in just one sample by setting the `delete_single_peak` argument to `TRUE`

5. Delete all peaks that occur in negative control samples by specifying their names as argument to `blanks`
   
## Input data

### Extraction of chromatogram peaks outside of GCalignR

The statistical analysis of GC or GC-MS data is usually based on the detection of substance peaks within chromatograms instead of the full chromatogram. This can be done with proprietary software or free programs such as AMDIS [@stein1999integrated]. The extraction of peaks from chromatograms is based on a certain threshold which might severely influence the quality of the alignment with `GCalignR`. If for instance the peak data includes very small peaks that occurred in a very low abundance, the retention time of the peak itself will have a higher potential error than highly abundant and sharp peaks.

The peak data of a chromatogram usually contain the retention time of a given peak plus additional information such as the area under the peak or its height which are used in the subsequent analysis. 
`GCalignR` uses the retention times (and not the mass-spectra, which may not be available, e.g. when using gas-chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID)) to align the peaks across individuals for subsequent chemometric analysis and pattern detection. The simple assumption is that peaks with similar retention times represent the same substances. However, it is highly recommended to verify this assumption by comparing also the mass-spectra (if available) of the substances of interest.

### Input file format
The input file for GCalignR is a plain text file, whereby all elements should be separated by tabs (with
sep = "/t") or any other separator, which has to be specified with the `sep` argument (see
`?read.table` for a list of separators). The decimal seperator has to be the point. 

* The first row contains the sample names, whereby every name must be unique. Names should not contain whitespaces and use the underscore as the only special character. 

* The second row
contains the names of the data columns. For example, if both the retention time of a peak as well as the area under the peak have been extracted you would write `RT area` into the second line. You can however add more variables such as the peak height. The variable names should not
contain whitespaces and use the underscore as the only special character. 

* Starting with the third row, the actual peak data is included, whereby single samples are concatenated horizontally. Each chromatogram needs to consist of the same number of columns, whereby at least one containing retention times is required. In order to use the functionality of the function `norm_peaks` an additional column containing a concentration measure (e.g. height or area of peaks) is required. The decimal separator has to be the point (not comma!).

```{r, out.width = 650, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("example.jpg") 
```

Naturally, not all chromatograms contain the same number of peaks.

```{r, out.width = 650, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("example2.jpg") 
```

### Alternative input from R

Alternatively to reading a text file, GCalignR also takes input directly from R. Here, `data`
has to be a `list` of `data frames`. Each `list` element (`data frame`) has the identity of a sample as its name and the `data frame` itself contains the gc peak data for this sample (again, the minimum number of columns is one column for the retention time and one column for another variable such as the area under the peak or it's height is required for using `norm_peaks`). All column names within `data frames` have to be the same. The attached dataset `peak_data` contains data from skin swabs of Antarctic Fur Seals *Arctocephalus gazella* [@stoffel2015chemical]


```{r} 
data("peak_data")
length(peak_data) # number of individuals, i.e. number of list elements
names(peak_data) # names of individuals, i.e. names of list elements 
head(peak_data[[1]]) # column names and data, i.e. one data.frame of list element 
```

## GCalignR workflow

### Check the input

To check the data formatting for the most common errors, use the `check_input` function. This will test for conformity with the the main requirements of the aligning algorithm and give a warning message if these aren't met. When a .text file is used as input, the decimal has to be a point (not a comma). However, there could potentially be a variety of different error sources so it is advisable to make  sure by yourself that the data is in the correct format.

```{r}
# if plot = T, a histogram of peaks is plotted
check_input(data = peak_data,plot = F)  
```

One of the steps in the algorithm is to adjust peaks that potentially represent the same substances but show slight differences in their retention times. For the parameter `min_diff_peak2peak` in the main function `align_chromatograms` it is therefore good to know about the difference between two peaks or substances within a chromatogram. The `peak_interspace` function plots the distances between adjacent peaks in the data. This will give an insight into how to specify the minimum difference in retention times of two different substances in a dataset with the `min_diff_peak2peak` parameter. Here we are plotting just a certain `quantile_range` of the data, as we are primarily interested in the minimum distance between peaks. Note, the differences between peaks presented here are derived within samples.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height = 5}
peak_interspace(data = peak_data, rt_col_name = "time",
                quantile_range = c(0, 0.8), quantiles = 0.05)
```

The histogram shows the distribution of retention-time 'spaces' between peaks. Most peaks are around 0.05 minutes apart from each other. From the distribution we want to infer the potential error-margin around a peak,that GCalignR will correct. We can see from the histogram that very few peaks are closer together than 0.03 minutes. By looking at the original chromatograms it becomes clear that these peaks are usually substances with low concentration which show a 'double peak', i.e. two peaks appear for what we believe is just a single substance. Therefore, we decide to take a value of 0.03 for the `min_diff_peak2peak` parameter below. It is noteworthy that this does not set a strict threshold and substances with a smaller difference in mean retention times can still be formed during the alignment (because those peaks are known to exist within samples). Therefore, we suggest to carefully check the aligned data and revise the initial peak calling if required.

### Align chromatograms

The core function in `GCalignR` is `align_chromatograms`, which will align the peak lists 
with the algorithm described above. See `?align_chromatograms` for a detailed description of the arguments. The alignment process will take minutes to several hours on a standard computer depending on mainly three factors; (1) the number of samples and (2) the number of peaks per sample and (3) the number of substances that are classified during the alignment procedure. The latter prevents us from predicting the computational effort.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
peak_data <- peak_data[1:4] # subset for speed reasons
peak_data_aligned <- align_chromatograms(data = peak_data, # input data
    rt_col_name = "time", # retention time variable name 
    rt_cutoff_low = 15, # remove peaks below 15 Minutes
    rt_cutoff_high = 45, # remove peaks exceeding 45 Minutes
    reference = NULL, # choose automatically 
    max_linear_shift = 0.05, # max. shift for linear corrections
    max_diff_peak2mean = 0.03, # max. distance of a peak to the mean across samples
    min_diff_peak2peak = 0.03, # min. expected distance between peaks 
    blanks = "C2", # negative control
    delete_single_peak = TRUE, # delete peaks that are present in just one sample 
    write_output = NULL) # add variable names to write aligned data to text files
```

The aligned data matrices are now stored in `data frame's` which can be accessed as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
peak_data_aligned$aligned$time # to access the aligned retention times
peak_data_aligned$aligned$area # to access the aligned area data
```

The package includes the already aligned data set for all samples:
```{r}
data("aligned_peak_data") 
``` 

### Visual diagnostics for the aligned data

The `gc_heatmap` function can be used to visualise aligned datasets. A white filling indicates the absence of a peak in a sample, when using the default option of a binary heatmap. The basic rationale of the alignment is to sort the substances with very similar retention times together, as they most likely represent one substance. The heatmap shows how the single peaks for the individuals deviate from the mean retention time of a substance. As a rule of thumb: The larger the deviation, the less likely it is the same substance. This is especially true if one or few samples deviate significantly, whereas other substances might be more variable than others. However, going back to the original chromatograms and looking at the quality of the peak might help. The heatmap can be invoked using custom threshold values. As an first orientation the default value of 0.05 can be used to inspect outliers among substances. The actual variation that will be observed on substance level will also depend on the alignment parameters, i.e. larger deviations have to be expected with increasing distance between peaks specified by `min_diff_peak2peak` in `align_chromatograms`. Check out the documentation with \code{?gc_heatmap} for further possibilities.

```{r,message=FALSE,fig.width=8,fig.height=8}
gc_heatmap(aligned_peak_data,threshold = 0.03) 
```

The plot function shows a four figure plot for the aligned data. The first histogram shows the number of peaks per sample before and after alignment. The number of peaks is much smaller after the alignment as peaks have been deleted which were present in the control samples, as well as peaks that were found in just a single individual. The histograms on the bottom left shows the full chromatogram shifts (the first step in the algorithm). The bottom middle shows how much peaks vary around their means across samples. The histogram on the bottom right shows how many peaks are shared across samples. In this case, there is just a single substance present in all samples, while often 10-12 samples share a single substance (the mode of the distribution).

```{r,message=FALSE,fig.width=8,fig.height=8}
plot(aligned_peak_data,which_plot = "all") # Plots, can be invoked separetely
```

Also, print provides a verbal summary of the alignment procedure.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
print(aligned_peak_data) 
```

### Normalise peaks and log+1 transformation

`norm_peaks` is used to standardize the concentration of peaks across samples to obtain the relative abundance. This is an essential step prior to the analysis if the absolute concentration of chemicals varies across samples. Note that this step is required when retention time cut-offs, single peak deletion or blank peak removal was applied, even if the data already contained a measure of relative abundance. The output is a list of data frames containing the relative abundance of peaks for every individual.

```{r}
## normalise area and return a data frame
scent <- norm_peaks(aligned_peak_data, conc_col_name = "area",rt_col_name = "time",out = "data.frame") 
## common transformation for abundance data to reduce the extent of mean-variance trends
scent <- log(scent + 1) 
```

### Visualise patterns by ordination plots using the *vegan* package

`vegan` offers a variety of useful function for the analysis of multivariate abundance data such as the scent profiles handled here. Check out \code{?vegan} for a first overview. 

### Non-metric multidimensional scaling 
```{r, results = 'hide'}
## GCalignR contains factors for the chemical dataset
data("peak_factors") 
## keep order of rows consistent
scent <- scent[match(row.names(peak_factors),row.names(scent)),] 
## NMDS using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities
scent_nmds <- vegan::metaMDS(comm = scent, distance = "bray")
## get x and y coordinates
scent_nmds <- as.data.frame(scent_nmds[["points"]])  
## add the colony as a factor to each sample
scent_nmds <- cbind(scent_nmds,colony = peak_factors[["colony"]])
```

```{r,fig.align="center"}
## ordiplot with ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = scent_nmds,aes(MDS1,MDS2,color = colony)) +
    geom_point(size = 4) + 
    stat_ellipse(size = 2) + 
    labs(title = "", x = "MDS1", y = "MDS2") +  
    theme_void() + 
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(colour = "black", size = 2,fill = NA),aspect.ratio = 1)
```

### Multivariate analysis using *adonis*
Using **adonis** and **betadisper** we can immediately do multivariate statistics, showing that the two colonies differ significantly. This illustrates a location effect.
```{r}
## colony effect
vegan::adonis(scent ~ peak_factors$colony,permutations = 999) 
## no dispersion effect
anova(vegan::betadisper(vegan::vegdist(scent),peak_factors$colony))
```
